Then answer the following question.

Q1 - Why do we use git? 
Ans: Git is a distributed version control system for keeping track of changes in any set of files. Using Git large teams can collaboratively work developing code during the development of any software and also as it is a version control system the changes made can anytime be reverted according to the need or in case the changed code is required.

Q2 - What is meant by forking and cloning a repo? 
Ans: Forking creates your own copy of a repository in a remote location (for example, GitHub). Your own copy means that you will be able to contribute changes to your copy of the repository without affecting the original repository. Cloning makes a local copy of a repository, not your own copy. Unlike forks, clones have references to their original repositories.

Q3 - a) What do you understand about the Staging area in Git?
    Ans: The staging area can be described as a preview of your next commit. When you create a git commit, Git takes changes that are in the staging area and make them as a new commit. You are allowed to add and remove changes from the staging area. The staging area can be considered as a real area where git stores the changes.

Q3 - b) What does the git push command do? 
    Ans:The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
